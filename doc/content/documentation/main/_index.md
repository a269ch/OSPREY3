# main branch

This documentation tracks the [`main` branch](https://github.com/donaldlab/OSPREY3/tree/main)
of Osprey development, rather than any specific version.
It is always the most up-to-date version of the documentation,
but it won't match any particular release of Osprey you have installed.
